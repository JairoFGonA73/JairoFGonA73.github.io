    <h1>In Plato Cave Reflection</h1>

    <p>The way I use photography or would like to use it is to capture a moment or of someone I do not ever want to forget. Like I have terrible memory which makes it harder for me to remember the good old times. And even though as a kid I hated taking pictures because I would have to fake a smile in front of the camera, as an adult I realize how important they are to me. When I usually take a photo, I would do it when nobody is looking since I never like the idea of staging the photo since it can make some people uncomfortable. But when I capture them just goofing around to me, I just capture a “real” moment. </p> 

 <p>That is why photography is important when visualizing the world, both its past and present. They provide evidence for someone's existence like say family album. They contain photos of parents, grandparents, relatives, old, and young. Highlighting a different point in time.</p> 	<p>Another example would be vintage photos of a certain area. To which, historians or people who like going down memory lanes and compare them to the present time. A then and now moment. If you had not noticed yet, these photos bring the feeling of nostalgia for the people who lived during this time; whether it be a good or bad memory. </p> 

<p>Photography can also capture the beauty this world offers. or the ugliness that it hides. Photos can capture the beauty of city structures, culture, and people. And you can get a better understanding of who or what they are and represent. However, photography can also highlight city crimes, oppression, poverty, destruction, etc. </p> 

<p>You can also paint what the people are feeling inside or how they see the world from their perspective. </p> 

<p>Another thing, these photos can also capture moments before or after a tragedy or disaster occurred. One moment you see a happy family taking a picture, only to later discover that the father murdered all of them days later. Or you can see how war affects those who were caught in the crossfire. Even, seeing the bloodshed that was unfolding that day. So, it can be rare if these photos survive with people in power always trying to cover up. </p> 

<p>There are also the power photos can have on people's lives. For example, if someone sees someone else doing something they were not supposed to do or in a “predicament.” That person who was able to capture the moment on their phone or camera now has leverage over you. And they know that since the photos they took can stain your image, leading to a termination of their career and social/personal life. I see this happening more with photographers in LA or anywhere where a celebrity shows up, and you just see all of them just taking photos, seeing who will get the best shot or a shot that can make you look bad. Truely, it only takes one photo to change the world's perception of something. </p>
