    <h1>'AI Slop' Reflection</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>At first, the idea of AI-generated art/videos was enticing to me and others. All you had to do was type up the image or scenario you wanted, and presto, it was created. I believe most people should be able to tell if a piece of artwork or a video is AI-generated because of how obscure it can be. For me, one way you could tell is how smooth the characters or background are.</p>

<p>Other times, in a video, for example, the characters can look almost soulless, and even their voices do not sound human but rather machine-made. And the stuff in these AI-generated videos would showcase a level of obscurity, for example, “realistic” animals just talking and acting like humans, or “realistic” people who have distinctive traits yet do not exist.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, AI is always evolving, always adapting. Meaning these images or videos will look increasingly realistic, even if there is still that level of obscurity. I believe this is what the article is warning us about: that one day we would not be able to tell whether something is real or not.</p>

<p>This may be a reason why people fear the use of AI, as it may very well be the cause of things going south one day or lead to the creation of something vile and sick. Imagine someone hacking into the White House socials like X and decided to do a “prank” by posting a video of Donald Trump declaring war on a certain country. This “prank” would obviously cause a worldwide panic, and even after they have deleted the post and stated it was an error, the damage has already been done. The public will see the US government as untrustworthy, but even more, our own allies as well. Another example is what if someone used AI to create some incriminating photos of someone they hate and send them to the police, and if they believe they are real, it might as well destroy that person’s reputation and life. In other words, AI will become something that gives someone powers over others.</p>

<p>Another issue of people, such as children and old people, can be easily deceived by these images or art. As children can be impressionable and will believe anything they see online.  Old people grew up in a time when they did not have the technology we have today. Of course, both groups make them the perfect targets for manipulation, whether it be scammers trying to use these AI-generated videos to get credit card information to supposedly help with their supposed “cause.” Or it could be predators using AI-generated art to create images of your child's likeness for their own sick pleasure.</p>

<p>And speaking of creating life for one own pleasure, there are, of course, sites where you can create your own digital “sex-partner.” This is where the boundary between reality and fantasy breaks once more, as people are starting to believe these are actually “real people” who actually “love them.” It is sad, but it is also pathetic.</p>
