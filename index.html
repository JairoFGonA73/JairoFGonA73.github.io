	<h2>Creative Statement</h2>
<p> I want to one day work in the animation business. The way I see it, the art I am trying to create 
To how I create my art, I need to listen to music since I find it inspiring. Like it evokes a certain emotion/feeling within me. Using this, I picture the type of scene that reflects what I am feeling. Whether it is a battle, a meeting, or a design of characters. And for that last part, I use references depending on what I am making. For example, I see creatures from mythology (China, Norse) or figures and creatures from the Bible and take my own spin of it. The same goes for clothing, setting, and expressions
To explain what my art is, it is an adventure, a story to be told. Like I dreamed of one day
creating a project featuring all the characters that I pictured every day. Waiting for their story to be told. However, that does not mean it will be all sunshine and rainbows. Afterall, stories can also be dark and gritting. And those will highlight my internal struggles as well as the rawemotions I have towards the world and the issues it has.
There are many reasons why I create the art I do. It can be a form of expression since I
always had trouble just explaining what I mean. And so, it is better to show it. I want the world to see what I have been seeing or thinking inside this mad mind of mine. Furthermore, I also wanted my art to inspire others in letting their imagination go as wild as I have. .
