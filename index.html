	<h2>Creative Statement</h2>
	<p>
	To what exactly is my art? Well, it is an expression of what I think daily. Whether it be what I am currently going through, such as my anxiety attacks, depression, hunger, or body pain. Picture this example when I am feeling like my neck or lower back starts to bother, spikes are coming out. Strange right? To me, that is far from strange, considering my other works. Like when I am feeling so exhausted, I picture myself as this rundown robot who keeps having to replace his energy cells to keep going. Or if I am having stomach problems, I picture myself replacing my stomach with a new one. For me, my art allows me to create an escape. It is these very pictures in my head that have kept both mind and body from falling apart, in a way. </p>
<p> There is also this sense of adventure that my art can portray. I dreamt of creating such an adventure that would make the world pause and wonder what would be next. Having creatures or beings that are zany, weird, mystical, powerful, weak, etc. Exploring worlds beyond Earth’s realm. But the one thing I wanted with this type of art is that there are no limits other than the artist's imagination. For the world should see something when everything is on the table, but not all at once. </p>
<p> However, when I turn to my darker emotions, such as anger, sadness, or downright soullessness, you can see and feel the shift. It may as well make you question my sanity, as with this type of art, you see the darkness one person can hold. Let me give you an example, you see, when I get angry, similar to my favorite character, the Hulk, I picture myself becoming this hateful creature that looks like the devil himself. Or if someone does something that just pisses me off, I just picture myself doing something “devilish” to make sure they don’t screw with me anymore. </p>
<p> When it comes to my inspirations for my artwork, there is quite a lot. It ranges from comics such as Marvel and DC. To animated or live TV shows like Animaniacs, Gravity Falls, The Amazing World of Gumball, and The Muppets Show. To anime such as One Piece, Lupin the Third, and One Punch Man. To games, FNAF, Poppy Playtime, and Marvel Rivals. And movies from Disney, WB, and just horror films like Chucky, Saw, Final Destination, etc.</p>
<p> To explain why I create the art I do, well, it’s for two reasons. The first one is pretty standard; it is for the world to hear my thoughts through my art. But the second reason is something I keep seeing the world is lacking. Imagination. I am tired of seeing prequels, sequels, spinoffs, and reboots. To me, they add more to the story, which is good depending on how well they do it. But it can also ruin what made the first film awesome because studios wanted more money. But the message I am trying to say is, let your imagination run wild, let us stop making this world more boring.
