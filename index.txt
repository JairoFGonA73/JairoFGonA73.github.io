	<h2>Creative Statement</h2>
	<p> 
I want to one day work in the animation business. The way I see it, the art I am producing is to inspire others to let their imagination go wild. I want the world to turn upside down when they look at stuff I am producing. Of course in a good way. For God sakes, I'm tired of seeing reboots, sequels, spinoffs. Just the same stuff rewritten to make it seems it was new!? You may say, "Well studios do put out new content but the people just do not watch it" But I say that is just a load of crud. You wanna know why? It is because they still are afraid of getting out of their comfort zones. That is why recent films like Sinners succeeded for it was a refreshing new idea. But enough of this rambling. To tell you how I create my art, I need to listen to music since I find it inspiring. To me, it evokes a certain emotion/feeling within me which helps me picture the type of scene I am going for. I often use references from mythology (China, Norse) or tales from the Bible. The same goes for clothing, setting, and expressions. At first, I make my art to be weird and to not make sense. I want you to have the expression total confused. Why? It is because I want you the viewer to have your own take of the art. I want to hear your thoughts, opinions and questions. After all, would not that be more fun rather than just telling you the answer.
