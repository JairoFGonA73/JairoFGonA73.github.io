    The reason I chose this photo in particular is because of how surreal it is to the viewer's eye. To me, the more I look at it, the more questions I have. Why was it created? Who do these heads represent? Sure, it’s part of the church connected to Hunter. But it's just interesting to me why Hunter has something like this and has kept it till the modern day. I know it's rare for students such as myself to not really pay attention to our surroundings. Mainly since we either have classes to go to, chat with friends, or just look at our phones. And so, when I altered the photo, I wanted to create more of this eerie vibe, making it look degraded as well as a photo that you would find in the archives. Which, in turn, adds more to the mystery of this structure.
